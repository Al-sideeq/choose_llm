Co-Founder and CTO
Nebula.io

I’m the co-founder and CTO of Nebula.io. We help recruiters source, understand, engage and manage talent, using Generative AI and other forms of machine learning. Our patented model matches people with roles with greater accuracy and speed than previously imaginable — no keywords required. Take a look for yourself at https://nebula.io; it’s completely free to try.

Our long term goal is to help people discover their potential and pursue their reason for being, motivated by a concept called Ikigai. We help people find roles where they will be most fulfilled and successful; as a result, we will raise the level of human prosperity. It sounds grandiose, but since 77% of people don’t consider themselves inspired or engaged at work, it’s completely within our reach.
